<h1>Accessing ESG Data Through netCDF</h1>

<h2><a name="Introduction"><u>Introduction</u></a></h2>
It is possible to access Earth Systems Grid (ESG) datasets
from ESG servers through the netCDF API.
This requires building the netCDF library with DAP2 protocol support
using the "--enable-dap" flag to the configure program.
<p>
In order to access ESG datasets, however, it is necessary to
register as a user with ESG and to setup your environment
so that proper authentication is established between a netCDF
client program and the ESG data server.  Specifically, it
is necessary to use what is called "client-side keys" to
enable this authentication. Normally, when a client accesses
a server in a secure fashion (using "https"), the server
provides an authentication certificate to the client.
With client-side keys, the client must also provide a
certificate to the server so that the server can know with
whom it is communicating.
<p>
It is possible to set up the netCDF library to use
client-side keys, although the process is 
somewhat complicated. The DAP2 support in netCDF
uses the <i>curl</i> library and it is that underlying library
that must be properly configured.

<h2><a name="terms"><u>Terminology</u></a></h2>
The key elements for client-side keys requires the constructions of
two "stores" on the client side.
<ul>
<li> Keystore - a repository to hold the client side key.
<li> Truststore - a repository to hold a chain of certificates
                  that can be used to validate the certificate
		  sent by the server to the client.
</ul>
The server actually has a similar set of stores, but the client
need not be concerned with those.

<h2><a name="steps1"><u>Initial Steps</u></a></h2>

The first step is to obtain authorization from ESG.
Note that this information may evolve over time, and
may be out of date.
This discussion is in terms of BADC ESG. You will need
to substitute the ESG site for BADC in the following.
<ol>
<li> Register at http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/register
   to obtain access to badc and to obtain an openid,
   which will looks something like:
   <pre>https://ceda.ac.uk/openid/Firstname.Lastname</pre>
<li> Ask BADC for access to whatever datasets are of interest.
<p>
<li> Obtain short term credentials at
   http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/MyProxyLogon/
   You will need to download and run the MyProxyLogon
   program.
   This will create a keyfile in, typically, the directory globus.
   The keyfile will have a name similar to this: x509up_u13615
   The other elements in ~/.globus are certificates to use in
   validating the certificate your client gets from the server.
<p>
<li> Obtain the program source ImportKey.java
   from this location: http://www.agentbob.info/agentbob/79-AB.html
   (read the whole page, it will help you understand the remaining steps).
</ol>

<h2><a name="steps2"><u>Building the KeyStore</u></a></h2>
You will have to modify the keyfile in the previous step
and then create a keystore and install the key and a certificate.
The commands are these:
<pre>
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in x509up_u13615 -inform PEM -out key.der -outform DER

    openssl x509 -in x509up_u13615 -inform PEM -out cert.der -outform DER

    java -classpath <path to ImportKey.class> -Dkeypassword="<password>" -Dkeystore=./<keystorefilename> key.der cert.der
</pre>     
Note, the file names "key.der" and "cert.der" can be whatever you choose.
It is probably best to leave the .der extension, though.

<h2><a name="steps2"><u>Building the TrustStore</u></a></h2>
Building the truststore is a bit tricky because as provided, the
certificates in "globus" need some massaging. See the script below
for the details. The primary command is this, which is executed for every
certificate, c, in globus. It sticks the certificate into the file
named "truststore"
<pre>
  keytool -trustcacerts -storepass "password" -v -keystore "truststore"  -importcert -file "${c}"
</pre>

<h2><a name="steps2"><u>Running the C Client</u></a></h2>

The file ".dodsrc" is used to configure curl. This file must
reside either in the current directory or in your home directory.
It has lines of the form
<ul>
<li>KEY=VALUE, or
<li>[http//x.y/]KEY=VALUE
</ul>
The first form provides a configuration parameter that applies
to all DAP2 accesses. The second form only applies
to accesses to the server at "x.y".
<p>
The following keys must be set in ".dodsrc" to support
ESG access.
<ul>
<li> HTTP.SSL.VALIDATE=1
<li> HTTP.COOKIEJAR=.dods_cookies
<li> HTTP.SSL.CERTIFICATE=esgkeystore
<li> HTTP.SSL.KEY=esgkeystore
<li> HTTP.SSL.CAPATH=.globus
</ul>
For ESG, the HTTP.SSL.CERTIFICATE and HTTP.SSL.KEY
entries should have same value, which is the file path for the
certificate produced by MyProxyLogon.  The HTTP.SSL.CAPATH entry
should be the path to the "certificates" directory produced by
MyProxyLogon.

<h2><a name="steps2"><u>Running the Java Client</u></a></h2>
If you are using the Java netCDF client, then you need to add
some parameters to the "java" command. Specifically, add the following
flags.
<pre>
   -Dkeystore="path to keystore file" -Dkeystorepassword="keystore password"
</pre>

<h2><a name="script"><u>Script for creating Stores</u></a></h2>
The following script shows in detail how to actually construct the key
and trust stores. It is specific to the format of the globus file
as it was when ESG support was first added. It may have changed
since then, in which case, you will need to seek some help
in fixing this script. It would help if you communicated
what you changed to the author so this document can be updated.
