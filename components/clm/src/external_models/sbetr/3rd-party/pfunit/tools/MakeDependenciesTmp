# pFUnit source/MakeDependenciesIncludeCollectUseStatements

# Collect into $3 the USE statements from $2, the preprocessed version
#   of $1.  These are collected into the pattern:
#   filename.o:  usePredicate1.F90...
# 
#  $1 is the file.F90
#  $2 is the file_cpp.f90
#  $3 is the outfile dependencies?.tmp
#  $4 is modules to ignore

# We do not automatically check to see if references are satisfied
# within the using file, so we can IGNORE those references by naming
# them here.
#
# Note: PrivateException is in Exception.F90, there is no
# PrivateException.F90 or PrivateException.o.
#
# IGNORE="PrivateException"
IGNORE=$4

# May need to consider case, however if we stick to our current coding
# style, we should be okay.

# Have trouble with commented use statements... see grep -v "\!" below.
# Need to watch out for use statements that refer to tokens with use or used.
# Also may have some trouble with files/modules with "use" in their names.
