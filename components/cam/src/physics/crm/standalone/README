ACME CRM STANDALONE

A typical workflow is below. For all options and defaults for setup.sh (my analog of CAM's bld/configure utility), please see the script itself, where everything is spelled out in the header.

cd standalone
source environments/env_[MACH]_[COMPILER].sh
cd utils
./setup.sh -build_root /path/to/build/directory -crm_root /path/to/ACME-ECP/components/cam/src/physics/crm [other options]
cd /path/to/build/directory
make -j8
