Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)
================================================================================

The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) project, previously known as ACME,
is developing a computationally advanced coupled climate-energy model to 
investigate the challenges posed by the interactions of weather-climate scale 
variability with energy and related sectors.
